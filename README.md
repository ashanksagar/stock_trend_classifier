# ML Stock Trend Classifier

An interactive **machine learning web app** that predicts next-day stock price direction using technical indicators and historical data.  
Built with **Python, XGBoost, and Streamlit**, this project combines financial analytics, feature engineering, and automated model retraining to demonstrate data-driven market forecasting.

**Live Demo:** [aistockpredictor.streamlit.app](https://aistockpredictor.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

The app allows users to visualize stock performance, technical indicators, and model predictions in real time.  
It supports multiple tickers (AAPL, TSLA, SPY, etc.) and compares the modelâ€™s backtested performance against buy-and-hold benchmarks.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Pipeline**
  - Trains XGBoost classifiers on engineered features such as RSI, MACD, moving averages, and volatility bands.  
  - Uses Optuna for hyperparameter tuning to maximize predictive accuracy and risk-adjusted return.

- **Dynamic Visualization**
  - Interactive Streamlit dashboard with stock charts, trend overlays, and prediction markers.  
  - Real-time metric updates (accuracy, Sharpe ratio, cumulative return).

- **Backtesting Engine**
  - Custom Python backtester simulates trading with transaction costs and confidence thresholds.  
  - Evaluates risk-adjusted performance vs. baseline strategies.

- **Automated Daily Retraining (GitHub Actions)**
  - Integrated **GitHub Actions workflow** fetches the latest market data each morning.  
  - Automatically updates datasets, retrains the XGBoost models, and redeploys the latest version of the app.  
  - Ensures predictions remain accurate and reflect current market conditions without manual intervention.

- **Multi-Ticker Analysis**
  - Tests across 50 S&P 500 stocks.  
  - 56% outperform buy-and-hold; top Sharpe ratio **4.14** and cumulative return **65.9%** (TSLA).

- **Deployment-Ready**
  - Packaged and deployed via Streamlit Cloud for public access.  
  - Lightweight, reproducible setup
